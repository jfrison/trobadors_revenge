== VeF integration == 
* looks like nothing is implemented for the Union of Aix except the change of owner for Nice (at a wrong date). Maybe I should add an Hungarian/Durrazzo faction for this period. 

== Factions ==
* GUI has to be hard-coded, so that if for some reason some unexpected non-occitan country appears (for instance because of Provence releasing Anjou after converting the provinces, or because of another mod adding a small French vassal), there will be no GUI, therefore the event will desactivate factions (we could still keep them for AI but that's dangerous)
* Republican faction is a bit tasteless for the moment. In particular, VeF could allow something like a republic of Marseille if republicans+rebels, plus maybe some less historic ones.
* Triggered modifier for republican and aragonese didn't work last time. Needs further testing. Finally looks OK... 

== Advisors ==
* Could we have female trobairitz? The presence of women was a bit of a specificity of the trobar. 

== Localisation ==
* French has been kind of abandonated. Maybe I should catch up before it's too late. 

== Decisions and Events ==
* The Aragon intervention in coalition with French vassals might need some opinion/attitude boost (or maybe a proper coalition) to make sure the alliance is not broken. This require more testing. 
* TODO: icons for modifiers
* TODO: I think the King René(Renat) was a bit of a trobador, they are problably some nice events to do about this
* TODO: neo-cathars? religion (~protestant) or just heretics?
* TODO: "Yo mamma" between rival (sirventes either written by you -hoping you are gifted- or by your trobador -if you have one-) => event launched by a sirventes in "discussing with your trobador" ?
* TODO: activable private jokes with provencialists and gascons?
* TODO: finish ruler-trobador, finish repub indep cities, finish repub events
