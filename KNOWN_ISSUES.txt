== VeF integration == 
* looks like nothing is implemented for the Union of Aix except the change of owner for Nice (at a wrong date). Maybe I should add an Hungarian/Durrazzo faction for this period. It won't come from SI as Marco starts in 1444. 
* I thought having my own event pictures would make sure I don't have "VeF vs Vanilla" conflicts but that's actually worse: the pictures need to have different sizes if VeF is here, which doesn't look possible in a single mod. 

== History ==
* The alternative scenario should turn Provence into Anjou, since it doesn't have any province in Province any more. Use MEIOU country ?

== Factions ==
* GUI has to be hard-coded, so that if for some reason some unexpected non-occitan country appears (for instance because of Provence releasing Anjou after converting the provinces, or because of another mod adding a small French vassal), there will be no GUI, therefore the event will desactivate factions (we could still keep them for AI but that's dangerous)
* Republican faction is a bit tasteless for the moment. 
* Triggered modifier for republican and aragonese didn't work last time. Needs further testing. Finally looks OK... 

== Advisors ==
* Could we have female trobairitz? The presence of women was a bit of a specificity of the trobar. 

== Localisation ==
* French has been kind of abandonated. Maybe I should catch up before it's too late. 

== Missions ==
* restore_occitan_independence doesn't work. I'ld like to find a general solution, without copy-pasting, it's probably possible in some way... 

== Decisions and Events ==
* The Aragon intervention in coalition with French vassals might need some opinion/attitude boost (or maybe a proper coalition) to make sure the alliance is not broken. This require more testing. 
* "Working on trobar" should be a ruler modifier, not country modifier, but then duration doesn't work
* When Marseille is released it is typically vassal of a vassal, then it cannot make war for independence  (this is a problem of the vanilla game, but maybe I should try to bypass this issue)
* Triggered modifiers fail sometimes, let's replace them by events

== TODO ==
* TODO: icons for modifiers
* TODO: I think the King René(Renat) was a bit of a trobador, they are problably some nice events to do about this
* TODO: neo-cathars? religion (~protestant) or just heretics?
* TODO: "Yo mamma" between rival (sirventes either written by you -hoping you are gifted- or by your trobador -if you have one-) => event launched by a sirventes in "discussing with your trobador" ?
* TODO: finish ruler-trobador, finish repub (non-city) events (use event revolution.1?)
* add modifiers "Academia dau Gay Saber" and so on, to use with Jocs Florals
* more faction dynamics
