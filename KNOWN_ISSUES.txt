== Graphics == 
* I thought having my own event pictures would make sure I don't have "VeF vs Vanilla" conflicts but that's actually worse: the pictures need to have different sizes if VeF is here, which doesn't look possible in a single mod. 
* No gfx for cathars if you don't have "VeF additional content" (for the moment it means that anyway you shouldn't have cathars). Having all the religion icons in a single dds file make it difficult to have something portable. Right now it doesn't deserve a "Vanilla additional content" mod or "Dei Gratia additional mod". 
* find a picture for mahometan scholar

== History ==
* The alternative scenario should turn Provence into Anjou, since it doesn't have any province in Province any more. Use MEIOU country ?
* looks like nothing is implemented for the Union of Aix except the change of owner for Nice (at a wrong date). Maybe I should add an Hungarian/Durrazzo faction for this period. It won't come from SI as Marco starts in 1444. 

== Factions ==
* GUI has to be hard-coded, so that if for some reason some unexpected non-occitan country appears (for instance because of Provence releasing Anjou after converting the provinces, or because of another mod adding a small French vassal), there will be no GUI, therefore the event will desactivate factions (we could still keep them for AI but that's dangerous)
* Republican faction is a bit tasteless for the moment. 
* If we're oscillating around the limit between two "faction rising" modifiers we spend some time with no modifier at all. This is a bit hard to optimise, so how much annoying is it? It looks like the modifier conditions are evaluated once for every modifiers to activate some and then once again for every modifier to desactivate those which need to be desactivated, rather than doing activation/desactivation in the same time. 

== Advisors ==
* Could we have female trobairitz? The presence of women was a bit of a specificity of the trobar. 

== Localisation ==
* French has been kind of abandonated. Maybe I should catch up before it's too late. 

== Decisions and Events ==
* The Aragon intervention in coalition with French vassals might need some opinion/attitude boost (or maybe a proper coalition) to make sure the alliance is not broken. This require more testing. 
* "Working on trobar" should be a ruler modifier, not country modifier, but then duration doesn't work
* When Marseille is released it is typically vassal of a vassal, then it cannot make war for independence  (this is a problem of the vanilla game, but maybe I should try to bypass this issue)

== Misc ==
* Most of my code has not taken RFR into account! It probably means the mod can't handle late dates for the moment.

== TODO ==
* TODO: icons for modifiers
* TODO: I think the King René(Renat) was a bit of a trobador, they are problably some nice events to do about this. Or just put the trobador modifier in history files. 
* TODO: "Yo mamma" between rival (sirventes either written by you -hoping you are gifted- or by your trobador -if you have one-) => event launched by a sirventes in "discussing with your trobador" ? => probably included in Jocs Florals
* TODO: finish ruler-trobador, finish repub (non-city) events (use event revolution.1?)
* add modifiers "Academia dau Gay Saber" and so on, to use with Jocs Florals
* write general events about mediterranean exchanges and tolerance to take advantage of the high tolerance of Occitans? Or should I leave that to VeF/DeiGratia/etc?
* "oil stain" for province_occitanism
* Find a solution for the name issue of mahometan_scholar (+female trob). 
* Write events when advisor=mahometan_scholar (wait until I have solved the name issue)
