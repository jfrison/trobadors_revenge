 trobador_tutorial_11_title: "Mod philosophy"
 trobador_tutorial_11_desc: "This mod concentrates on Occitania and Catalonia, giving them the opportunity to be more than subcultures within a cultural union, bound to disappear. It is made to be not only a mere flavouring component, but also to have very concrete consequences in term of gameplay. However, except if you start the Alternative-History scenario, the game will start in a state very similar to what it would have been without this mod. In that sense this mod does not correspond to the concept of Alternative-History. However, it kind of considers that even if a revival of the Occitan culture is relatively unlikely, it is the path the player is interested in. It means that we don't try to reproduce rigourously every detail of how historically France destroyed the Occitan culture. In this sense it is not a fully historical scenario neither. It is what I call Semi-Alternative History. "
 trobador_tutorial_12_title: "Historial background"
 trobador_tutorial_12_desc: "Occitania and Catalonia are what is now considered as the South of France and East of Spain. It designate lands which have been occupied by Greeks and Romans very early, long before Cesar's incursions in Gallia, and deeply colonised instead of just controlled militarily. Added to a relatively weak influence of the French and Wisigoth invasions, this resulted in a much more latin/mediterranean culture. As latin begun to decay into romance languages, the local variations of romance became one of the first languages to get a unified identity, under the impulsion of the trobadors (litterally 'finders'), who needed a koine for their poetry. The name of the language mainly came later from Dante's work, one of a first works of linguistics, which separated the romance languages into three groups according to the word 'yes' ('oc' in the West, 'oil' in the North and 'si' in the East). Dante's ambition was in great part to turn the italian dialects into something as prestigious as what Occitan was. Indeed, Occitan, usually called Limosin because many trobadors came from this region, became the most influent language for arts in Europe around centuries XIth-XIIIth, while latin was still used for science, laws and so on. However, this quickly collapsed after the Crusade against the Albigensians. The reasons of this Crusade were both religious (the Occitan lords being way too much tolerant towards heretics and heathens, or maybe more exactly the Franks and the Pope being much less tolerant than the Mediterranean standard) and political (Occitania and Catalonia were de-jure vassals of France. The gain of a King title by the House of Barcelona confirmed formally their independence, but it was still time for France to get back its influence in Occitania, which was mainly under the shared influence of the King of Aragon an their friend/rival/quasi-vassal the Count of Toulouse). The French victory in the Hundred Year War and the Black Death made it even worse, leaving Occitania under the complete control of France and unable to recover its strength, with its culture condemned to a slow decay. It is what you have to avoid!"
 trobador_tutorial_goto121: "What about the Alternative-History scenario?"
 trobador_tutorial_121_title: "What about the Alternative-History scenario?"
 trobador_tutorial_121_desc: "This scenario suppose that the Crusade failed and Occitania has been able to maintain a kind of statu-quo during one more century (not two nor three, it can only be played with Veritas et Fortitudo). Occitania is divided between the influence of France, Aragon and England, with Toulouse in the middle. Additionally, the game starts with Marseille being an independent country, which is a slight exageration of what some people call 'The Republic of Marseille'. The city spent most of the XIIIth century being de facto independent, taking advantage of the post-Crusade instability and the weakening of the Aragonese influence, before the House of Anjou put an end to this situation. Since I was not bound to History any more, I tried to take advantage of this to provide this different challenge to the players. "
 trobador_tutorial_13_title: "Occitanism and Catalanism"
 trobador_tutorial_13_desc: "In Trobador's Revenge the cultural aspect has several layers: you have a new culture group, the province occitanism, and the factions. Those three element work together to try to give some dynamics to the culture. "
 trobador_tutorial_goto131: "Culture Groups"
 trobador_tutorial_131_title: "Culture Groups"
 trobador_tutorial_131_desc: "The cultures groups in EUIV are a very static tree, which doesn't allow to have a culture in two different groups, to measure some cultural distance instead of a yes/no categorisation, or to make the culture evolve in time. Occitan in 1444 (or 1309 if you have VeF) is very different from Occitan in the later game, and what of the main aims of the mod is precisely to let the player change what 'Occitan' concretely means. Therefore an other culture-group has been added, 'Occitano-Catala', and the corresponding cultures can move from the Occitano-Catala group to the French/Iberian culture group, depending of how strong people are identificating themselves to one group or the other one."
 trobador_tutorial_goto132: "Province Occitanism"
 trobador_tutorial_132_title: "Province Occitanism"
 trobador_tutorial_132_desc: "Each province is described by a 'Province Occitanism' variable which evaluates to which culture group the people here (actually rather the local elites, not the peasants). This variable evolve smoothly as a function of many parameters, and can slowly spread to nearby provinces. It can get from 0 to 100, and the province will have its culture 'converted' when the variable goes past 50, in a direction or the other. Some decisions such as 'Give Birth to Occitanism' show the value of this variable in your capital, so that you always have an idea of what is happening."
 trobador_tutorial_goto133: "Factions"
 trobador_tutorial_133_title: "Factions"
 trobador_tutorial_133_desc: "The factions represent the opinion of the influential people in the central government, which is both different from the simple people and from the monarch alone, although those can interact. Different factions give different modifiers, which can be quite important, and the availability of many decisions and events depend on the faction in power. "
